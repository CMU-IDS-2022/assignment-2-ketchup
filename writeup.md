# Do Couples Always Sleep Together?

The project is inspired by a long-lasting question that many kids may have in their childhood: Why my parents don't sleep together?

FiveThirtyEight published an article [*Dear Mona, How Many Couples Sleep in Separate Beds?*](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-how-many-couples-sleep-in-separate-beds/) with the result of an online survey to explore people's sleeping arrangements with their partner. The survey provides answers to several intriguing questions: How many couples sleep in separate beds? What kind of people doesn't sleep with their partner? Why don't they sleep together? We visualize the dataset through an interactive web application that offers users the opportunity to explore this interesting dataset and unfold the untold.


## Project Goals

As discussed previously, we hope to use this dataset to answer why couples do not sleep together. This well-known but barely discussed question extends the discussion to the broader social psychology area. We utilized the demographic data collected in the survey, such as `age`, `gender`, `household income`, `occupation`, to excavate the insights behind it - are people with specific demographics associated with a higher possibility for sleeping separately with their partner?

Our web application enables users to first look at the dataset, understanding what was in the survey and the basic demographics of the respondents. With that knowledge in mind, we develop various topics stemming from the study and allow users to explore them based on their interests. As an example, one section enables users to see the correlation between demographics of those who sleep separately with their partner and the frequency of sleeping separately.


## Design

TODO: **A rationale for your design decisions.** How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?


## Development

TODO: **An overview of your development process.** Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time?

The project is developed by Kylie Hsieh and Erin Lin. The team works together throughout the project, but to be more specific, Kylie leads the data cleaning and software development, and Erin leads the document write-up and topic development.

We divide the project into three phases: (1) research and discovery, (2) design, and (3) development.
| Phase  | Task and Time Spent (in people-hours) |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Research and Discovery | - Explore and select dataset of interest (1)<br/> - Define project scope (1)<br/> -   |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
